								<h2>Description</h2>
								<p>In this puzzle the player has to use the tunnel to transport all the elements ( box, paint and the player itself), in addition the player has to use inertia to jump over the platform. </p>
								<!--<h2>Solution</h2>
                                <ol>

								        <p>The player has to get the box to revert the tunnel. To do this the player has to reverse the tunnel him/herself [1], create a portal for the tunnel [2], and a portal for the cube [3] to get the cube [4]. Finally, the player can make a portal near the botton [1] go to 3 and get the cube or change the portal in 2 to 1 just before the cube goes through the portal in 3. </p>
                                     </li>

								<h2>Comments</h2>
                                <p>As you will appreciate, the player can see the exit and the main objectives almost all the time.</p>
                                <img src="../../images/levels/b,o&wii/explicacion/1-intro.png" alt="alt text" style="width: 100%">
								<p>At the beginning of the level the player can see the main objectives: The box dropping, the tunnel, the exit and the upper platform. </p>

								<p>If the player turn to the right, then he/she can see the blue paint and where to put a portal to get the paint.</p>
                                <img src="../../images/levels/b,o&wii/explicacion/1.2-naranjaAbajo.png" alt="alt text" style="width: 100%">
								<p>If the player turn to the left, he/she can see the orange paint. But it is to difficult that the player can see where to put a portal to get the paint.</p>
                                <img src="../../images/levels/b,o&wii/explicacion/2-cogerCaja.png" alt="alt text" style="width: 100%">
								<p>When the player goes to get the cube, he/she can see all the short-term and long-term goals. Again, the player can see the exit.</p>
                                <img src="../../images/levels/b,o&wii/explicacion/3-muestraLaLanzadera.png" alt="alt text" class="centeredImage" style="width: 60%; ">
								<p>When the player cross to the other part of the level, the first he/she can see is the panel with a tilt. In a long-term goal, he/she can use this panel to go to the upper platform. And in a short-term goal, he/she can use it to paint the ground.</p>
                                <img src="../../images/levels/b,o&wii/explicacion/4-SeVeLaSalida.png" alt="alt text" style="width: 100%">
								<p>This is important, when the player through the tunnel, he/she can see the exit again.</p>
                                <img src="../../images/levels/b,o&wii/explicacion/5-SeVeTodo.png" alt="alt text" style="width: 100%">
								<p>When the player reach the source of the tunnel, is able to see all the interesting places to solve this part of the puzzle, and the upper platform as a long term-goal.</p>
                                <img src="../../images/levels/b,o&wii/explicacion/6-DesdeArriba.png" alt="alt text" style="width: 100%">
								<p>If the player uses the tunnel to go to the roof, he/she is able to see the exit and the tunnel again. And for the first time is able to see the entire upper platform.</p>
                                <img src="../../images/levels/b,o&wii/explicacion/8-arriba1.png" alt="alt text" style="width: 100%">
								<p>Once the player reach the upper platform, the first thing that he/she see is the exit in front of him/her and the tunnel.</p>
                                <img src="../../images/levels/b,o&wii/explicacion/10-ArribaCubo.png" alt="alt text" style="width: 100%">
								<p>Finally when the player places the cube the first thing he/she see is the tilted panel moving, giving a hint for the next movement.</p>
